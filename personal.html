    <h1>Welcome to my personal blog!</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>I am a highly motivated and inquisitive individual with a deep passion for technology and innovation. Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Jodhpur, I possess a diverse range of interests that encompass programming, writing, and the arts. I am dedicated to constant learning and personal growth, which has resulted in numerous accomplishments throughout my journey.</p>
    <p>In recognition of my exceptional academic performance, I was honored with the Outstanding Student Award during my tenth standard. Additionally, I have gained valuable hands-on experience working with technologies such as Python and SQL through projects I completed during my 11th and 12th standard. Alongside my technical skills, I actively engage in various clubs and organizations, including the dramatics club, SAA IIT Jodhpur, SWC Jodhpur, and ACM IIT Jodhpur.</p>
    <p>As a driven individual, I consistently seek out new opportunities to enhance my skills and contribute to my personal and professional development. I am particularly excited to further my education and tackle new challenges in the dynamic field of computer science and technology as a student at IIT Jodhpur.</p>
    <p>Apart from my technical pursuits, I have a deep passion for Dramatics. I proudly consider myself a "Tech Minded Thespian" and have been involved in acting since my school days. From 8th to 10th grade, I was an active member of the drama club, participating in competitions and winning prizes. While I dedicated my efforts to JEE preparations during 11th and 12th grade, I rekindled my love for drama after joining IIT Jodhpur. I had the opportunity to learn and perform Nukkad, eventually becoming the Joint Secretary of the Drama Society. College has been a transformative experience for me, enabling personal growth and providing opportunities to participate in theater and Nukkad at Inter IIT.</p>
    <p>In addition to my involvement in dramatics, I enjoy sketching, writing poems, and playing the guitar. I aspire to learn dance someday, as it aligns with my hunger for acquiring new skills. With a positive outlook on life, I approach challenges with determination and utilize my strengths and capabilities to overcome them.</p>
    <p>One quote by Shiv Khera that serves as a constant source of motivation for me is, "Your positive action combined with positive thinking results in success." This quote encapsulates my belief in the power of positivity and the importance of taking action to achieve success.</p>
    <p>I am enthusiastic about the future and excited to continue my journey of growth, knowledge, and exploration.</p>
